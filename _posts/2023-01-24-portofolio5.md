title: Optimization System Of Maintenance Training
date: 2023-01-24
---

The "Optimization System of Maintenance Training" project aims to address the problem of low effectiveness in maintenance training. The current issue is that there is no system in place for tracking and evaluating training performance in 2022. Through this project, we will implement an optimization system that will not only track training progress, but also evaluate the effectiveness of the training in order to identify areas of improvement. By doing so, we hope to increase the effectiveness of maintenance training and ultimately improve the overall performance of the maintenance team. To achieve this, we will work closely with the maintenance team to gather their input and ensure that the system is tailored to their specific needs.
